## OpenRouter data pages

The site also includes reproducible, source-attributed views of public demand:

- [Hybrid Architecture Trends](hybrid-trends.html): Mamba hybrids, linear-attention hybrids, and regular attention, including sparse attention.
- [Attention Style Trends](attention-trends.html): full, sparse, and local attention, linear and Mamba hybrids, and independently described KV representations.
- [Context Demand](context-demand.html): architecture shares and token growth within OpenRouter's request-context buckets.
- [Cache Telemetry & Prices](cache-telemetry.html): advertised cache prices and explicit limits on observed cache-hit and NVMe data.

```sh
npm ci
export OPEN_ROUTER_API  # supply the key securely in your environment
make openrouter        # update all OpenRouter data and pages
```

Individual targets are `openrouter-hybrid-trends`, `openrouter-attention-trends`, `openrouter-context`, and
`openrouter-cache`. To reproduce the committed snapshot without network access:

```sh
make openrouter-render OPENROUTER_END=2026-10-06
```

Updates default to yesterday in UTC, preserve historical data, and refresh a
seven-day overlap. Set `OPENROUTER_FULL_REFRESH=1` to refetch old history.
New models stay unclassified until their architecture evidence is reviewed.
The collector does not fetch private account analytics or publish API keys.
Cache prices and token traffic are not measurements of NVMe offloading.

## Controls

- **Play/Pause**: Start or stop the animation
- **Speed Control**: Adjust animation speed (0.5x to 100x) - now with ludicrous speed!
- **Next Model**: Cycle through different model architectures
- **Context Control**: Switch between SOTA context lengths:
  - 128K - Standard context
  - 200K - Claude 3.5 Sonnet
  - 1M - Llama 3.1 / standard long context
  - 2M - Gemini 1.5 Pro
  - 10M - Magic/research models
  - 100M - Theoretical future (prepare for memory apocalypse!)

## The Math Behind It

The visualization uses the exact KV cache formulas from [LMCache's KV Cache Calculator](https://lmcache.ai/kv_cache_calculator.html):

### Standard Models
```
KV Cache = 2 × layers × tokens × kv_heads × (hidden_size/attention_heads) × dtype_size
```

### DeepSeek Models (with KV-LoRA)
```
KV Cache = layers × tokens × (kv_lora_rank + qk_rope_head_dim) × dtype_size
```

## Model Architecture Innovations

### Qwen3-Next-80B: Breaking the Memory Wall
Based on the [Qwen3 Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09388) ([Audio summary](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uS9uYJOcSELtibF7LfWuU)), Qwen3-Next-80B introduces several groundbreaking optimizations:

- **Hybrid Attention Architecture**: 75% Gated DeltaNet (linear complexity) + 25% traditional attention for optimal memory-performance trade-off
- **Ultra-Sparse MoE**: 512 experts with only 11 activated per token, achieving 80B total capacity with 3B active parameters
- **Multi-Token Prediction**: Accelerates inference and improves speculative decoding acceptance rates
- **Long Context Optimization**: Native 262K context support, expandable to 1M tokens with minimal memory overhead

**Performance Gains**: 7-10x faster prefill, 4-10x faster decode, while using <80% of traditional model GPU hours.

### DeepSeek-V3: KV-LoRA Innovation
Uses KV-LoRA compression to achieve 7x memory reduction compared to standard transformer architectures.

## Cartridge Economics & Break-even

`cartridge-economics.html` is an interactive calculator answering: when does the
one-time cost of generating and training reusable per-document KV-cache
Cartridges, plus their persistent storage and loading costs, become cheaper than
repeatedly prefilling conventional RAG text?

It is inspired by *Cartridges at Scale: Training Modular KV Caches over Large
Document Collections* (Hardalov, Iglesias, de Gispert — Amazon AGI Lab,
[arXiv:2606.04557](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2606.04557)), which trains pools of
per-document Cartridges and selects them with chunk retrieval, matching Text-RAG
quality with 3-4x fewer prompt tokens.

### Cost equations

All capacity math is in bytes (binary units for display, decimal GB for cloud
billing). With `H` the Cartridge lifetime in months and `Q` the monthly query
volume:

```
cartridge_tokens        = source_tokens / compression_ratio
cartridge_bytes         = cartridge_tokens/1000 * MiB_per_1K * format_multiplier
build_cost              = (gpu_hours * $/gpu_hour + self_study + other) * (1 + retry_overhead)
rebuild_cost_month      = build_cost * corpus_fraction_retrained_month

path_cost_per_query     = billed_gpu_hours * $/gpu_hour / completed_requests   (primary)
compute_delta           = baseline_cost_query - cartridge_cost_query            (signed)
load_cost_query         = cold_objects * $/GET + cold_GB * ($/GB retrieval + $/GB egress)
net_saving_query        = realization * compute_delta - load_cost_query

fixed_month             = storage_month + rebuild_cost_month - baseline_storage_month
egress_overage_month    = max(0, egress_GB_month - 3 * stored_GB) * $/GB        (Backblaze)
break_even_queries      = (build_cost/H + fixed_month) / net_saving_query
                          (piecewise once the egress allowance binds)

baseline_lifetime_cost  = H * (Q * baseline_cost_query + baseline_storage_month)
cartridge_lifetime_cost = build_cost + H * (storage_month + rebuild_cost_month
                          + Q * (cartridge_cost_query + load_cost_query))
```

The crossover graph plots the two complete lifetime path costs; it never
reconstructs the Cartridge line as "baseline minus a delta", and it refuses to
put non-positive dollar values on its logarithmic axis. All deltas are signed:
a Cartridge path slower or dearer than the baseline shows up as a loss.

### Measurement boundaries and methodology

The primary inference-cost mode is billed GPU-hours divided by completed
matched requests per path (or a directly measured $ per 1K requests). Wall
latency × TP size × rate survives only as a labeled microbenchmark
approximation, because under continuous batching many requests share each
GPU-second — per-request wall latency is not exclusive GPU time, and treating
it as such overstates both paths. Matched runs should record model/checkpoint,
engine + commit, token counts, concurrency and batching policy, completed
requests, p50/p95 TTFT, throughput and a quality score; `cartridge-benchmarks.js`
is the schema for those records, including invalid runs and their defects.

Cartridge loading has an explicit boundary: either it is included in the
measured Cartridge-path cost and latency, or it is modeled separately (hit
rate, storage-to-GPU bandwidth, fixed per-object latency, GET/retrieval/egress
prices) — never both, so it cannot be double-counted or silently dropped.

### Baselines

The comparison baseline is selectable: *Uncached Text RAG* (repeated full
prefill — a valid experiment but a deliberately weak deployment baseline),
*Text RAG with ordinary KV/prefix reuse* (prefer measured all-in costs), or a
*custom measured baseline*. Storage is treated as a delta between the baseline
and Cartridge paths rather than charged only to Cartridges.

### What comes from the paper, and what does not

From arXiv:2606.04557: the BF16 KV MiB-per-1K-token table (Qwen3-0.6B/8B/32B),
LongHealth workload shapes (9,860 Text-RAG tokens/query at k=10, 2,673 and 566
Cartridge tokens/query at 20x/100x), average unique Cartridges per query, and
the training recipe (H200/B200, 80 epochs, ~12,400-14,160 optimizer steps,
batch 128, sequence 8,192). NOT from the paper: training GPU-hours or
wall-clock time, self-study generation cost, prefill wall times, production
per-request costs, and every calculator default marked with an *assumption*
badge (90% hit rate, 6-month lifetime, 100K queries/month). Sub-BF16
serialization formats are experimental projections the paper does not
validate; selecting one requires a format-specific quality result before any
viable verdict. Planning mode never emits a viable verdict at all — it is an
illustrative bound.

Storage and GPU prices are a static, dated, sourced snapshot in
`cartridge-pricing.js`; Backblaze's free-egress allowance is modeled at the
monthly aggregate, while R2 account-level free tiers and billing rounding are
deliberately unmodeled (omitting them can only overstate Cartridge-side
costs). The pure calculation functions are unit tested under Node
(`make test`).

## Why These Optimizations Matter

LMCache and modern model architectures address memory explosion through:
- Prefix caching to reuse computed KV states
- Compression techniques (KV-LoRA, quantization)
- Distributed caching across multiple nodes
- Architectural innovations (hybrid attention, sparse MoE)

This visualization demonstrates why such optimizations are critical for the future of LLMs.
